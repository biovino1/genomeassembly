This project simulates reads from the Locusta Migratory genome using wgsim and assembles the reads using SOAPdenovo. Various parameters are tested to see their affect on the assembly. This project is meant to run on a linux server, for which you can simply clone this repository and run the biovino_record.txt file to reproduce all results. Singularity must already be installed.
